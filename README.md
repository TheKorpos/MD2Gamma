# About the plugin

This plugin is made to enable formal verification of SysML statechart based behavioral models in MagicDraw. To achive its goal the plugin utilizes the [Gamma Statechart Composition Framework](https://inf.mit.bme.hu/node/6028) and [UPPAAL](http://www.uppaal.org/) by introducint a tranformation to Gamma's Statechart language which can be translated to UPPAAL models.

# Main Goals
* Transform statecharts to Gamma's statechart language
* Tranform composite models to Gamma's composite language
* Perform the formal verification using Gamma and UPPAAAL
* Introduce a new way to define the verifiable properties
* Generate simulations of erroneous behaviors
